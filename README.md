# Habit

Unfortunately, I only had a few hours of free time to work on this the past couple days but I wanted to display a use of Hilt and Room, which I did with a very simple, two-screen app. You'll see that if you restart the app, the tasks are persisted with Rooom. 

If I had more time I would add a ViewModel and Adapter, Unit tests and the rest of the functionality/screens such as Goals, Routines, and Habits. 

I also would have added some more functionality to the Task cells to add a "Check" for completed tasks and the capability to delete single tasks.

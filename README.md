# Habit

With this very simple start to a rework of my Habit app, I wanted to display a use of Hilt and Room, which I did with a simple, two-screen app. You'll see that if you restart the app, the tasks are persisted with Room. 

My next steps will be to add a ViewModel and Adapter, Unit tests and the rest of the functionality/screens such as Goals, Routines, and Habits. 

I'll also add some more functionality to the Task cells to add a "Check" for completed tasks and the capability to delete single tasks.
